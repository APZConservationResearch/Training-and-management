# Welcome!
Hello! And welcome to Assinboine Park Zoo's Conservation and Research Github. This repository contains the information and links neccesary to get new members/contributors started with Github and become familiarized with the rules and etiquette of the oganization's repositories.

## Getting Started

### Code of conduct

Assiniboine Park Conservancy is committed to "cultivate a culture of inclusivity that embraces diversity in all its forms including race, ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation;
grow a workforce that reflects the wonderfully diverse community we serve; and nurture a sense of community within our Park that makes all feel welcome, accepted and comfortable to be themselves."

Members and contributors of the APZ Conservation and Research Github will uphold these commitments of APC and will abide by the following:
* All communication should be appropriate for a professional and diverse audience.
* Harrasment of any kind is not tolerated, including but not limited to; offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, physical appearance, body size, race, and religion.
* Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.
* Comments and revisions to others' contributions is to be constructive and curteous.
* Ask questions! Coding is difficult and frustrating, but also rewarding. Everyone is at different stages of their coding experience but all of us are always learning. If you are stuck, remember you have a team who is always willing help!

### Training
* Learn the basic [theory of Git workflows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLycV1IWqc&t=1s&ab_channel=economicurtis).
* Learn the [theory of pull requests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=For9VtrQx58&ab_channel=Codecademy).
* Initialize and learn the mechanics of Github and RStudio by following along with this [tutorial](https://inbo.github.io/git-course/course_rstudio.html).
* Completely new to R? [Here](https://github.com/APZConservationResearch/Training-and-management/blob/main/R-training-links.md) is a list of useful links and training to get started using R.

For an in depth look at Git, Github, and RStudio, *[Happy Git With R](https://happygitwithr.com/)* introduces more complex workflows and is a good resource for the most common issues encountered.

### Repository Rules
* Never upload data to a repository without explicit consent from Dr. Petersen.
  * Ask the repository manager if you require a raw data file or the data file path.  
* Do not alter raw data. If alteration to the raw data file is necessary, make a copy of the raw data and note all changes made at the beginning of the coding script.
* Commit often using helpful and thoughtful commit messages.
* Unless you are the manager of the repository or have premission from the repository manager, a [branching and pull request workflow](https://inbo.github.io/git-course/workflow_rstudio.html) should be used.
* Do not leave branches unmerged for long periods of time.
* Use sensible file and folder names with no funky ch@r@ct√âr$.

### Coding Etiquette
Please read through and follow the [Coding Etiquette Guidelines](https://github.com/APZConservationResearch/Training-and-management/blob/main/Coding-etiquette.md).
