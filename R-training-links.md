## Community help
Stuck on an issue? Try asking the community!
* [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is the place you will most likely find the answer you are look for. If not, ask your own question! 
* [Reddit R help](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rlanguage/) is good but questions are less likely to be answered.
* Poorly phrased and formatted questions are not likely answered so it is important to learn [how to ask proper questions](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)
